In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined. If you attempt to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP will not throw an error, but instead return null. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly handled. Consider the following example:

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$value = $myArray['c']; // Accessing a non-existent key
echo $value; // Outputs nothing (null)
```

The problem is that the code silently handles the non-existent key.  If you were expecting an error to alert you or a default value, you will need to explicitly check for the key's existence before accessing it.

Another situation where this becomes problematic is when relying on the return value of functions that might not always set values. For example, a database query could return an empty result set, in which case accessing specific array elements derived from that query could lead to unexpected `null` values.
