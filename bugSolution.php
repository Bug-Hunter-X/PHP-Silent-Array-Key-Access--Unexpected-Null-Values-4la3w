To solve this, always check if a key exists before accessing it. PHP offers several ways to do this:

1. **Using `isset()`:**
```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
if (isset($myArray['c'])) {
    $value = $myArray['c'];
    echo $value; // This will not be executed
} else {
    echo "Key 'c' does not exist"; // Handle the missing key
}
```
2. **Using `array_key_exists()`:**
```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
if (array_key_exists('c', $myArray)) {
    $value = $myArray['c'];
    echo $value; //This will not be executed
} else {
    echo "Key 'c' does not exist"; // Handle the missing key
}
```

By implementing these checks, you ensure that your code gracefully handles situations where expected array keys might be missing, thus preventing unexpected behavior and making your applications more robust.
